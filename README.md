## Architectural decisions

- Used React as a Framework as I had some experience with it and I really like React because of the component structure
- Created different components to have a clear overview of the code. My "rule" is to have a max of 50 to 70 lines of code per component
- Added Bootstrap but haven't used it (yet)
